# AI in Medicine - Conference Workshop 2
## Image Processing with FastAI
This is the repository to use and follow along our second conference workshop on Image Processing with the FastAI library.

We will first be looking at the FastAI library, and using its utilities to:
  - Webscrape for image data
  - Quickly build a model with a pre-trained backbone
  - Evaluate our model and understand performance metrics
  - Experiment with our pipeline's components to improve our model
  - Learn how training data can affect the model's generalisability

I hope you enjoy this workshop and Imperial College Medics' Coding Society Conference on AI in Medicine.
Please [email me](mailto:at1120@ic.ac.uk) if you have any queries.
